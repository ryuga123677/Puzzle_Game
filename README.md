# Puzzle_Game
Hi I am Harshit and the idea of making this game came from Windows Purble Palace, I saw that game there and thought to make it in flutter. In this game firstly all tiles will display question mark and when you tap any of the tile then it will show some random fruit image, now you have to find the pair of that image by searching on rest tile if you pressed the wrong tile then it will automatically turn into question mark. If you pressed the right one then it will left over with that image.After you find all the pair ,then there is a bar at bottom which shows the result i.e. number of wrong and right taps.
